            <p>
                In September 2025, I started the Bachelor's program “Informatics” at <a href="https://www.imc.ac.at/"
                    target="_blank">IMC Krems</a>.
                The path that led me here was anything but straightforward:
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating from <a href="https://hluwweb4.cms.hluwyspertal.ac.at/" target="_blank">HLUW
                    Yspertal</a>, a higher vocational school specializing in natural sciences and business, I moved to
                Vienna to work as a secretary in a law firm.
                There, I gained professional experience in the legal field, which led to a position in the legal
                department of the <a href="https://noe.landarbeiterkammer.at/" target="_blank">NÖ
                    Landarbeiterkammer</a>.
                The NÖ Landarbeiterkammer represents the interests of workers and employees in agriculture and forestry
                in Lower Austria - a very unique institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                After two years of learning about Austrian labor law, payroll accounting, and the art of dispute
                resolution, I was offered the opportunity to switch to the IT department - an offer I gladly accepted.
                Suddenly, I found myself working with one colleague in a small IT department, with little prior
                knowledge in the field, and a lot of work to do.
                My tasks included managing databases, administering PCs and mobile devices, ensuring cybersecurity, and
                keeping our in-house server running, among other things.
                I loved the work, but after two years of trying to juggle all these responsibilities without a solid
                background in computer science, I realized it was time to pursue a comprehensive education in
                informatics.
                And, as far as I can tell, it was absolutely the right decision...
